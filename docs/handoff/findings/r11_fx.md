# Round 11 — fx: low fog life and clear, smoke roll-out

Metric (scripts/similarity.mjs, Show camera vs official video, Mac GPU, exact-time frames, `--settle 500
--min-frames 30`, pre-roll on): round-11 baseline 69.3 % raw / 53.5 % calibrated (colour 70.3, light 82.2, shape 57.1),
per moment in `research/video-timeline/data/similarity-mac-r11.json`. The requests come from the round-10 video-match
agents (all 11 spans, exact frames; their notes are research/video-timeline/NN.md — read the parts that concern you).

HOW THIS ROUND WORKS: you build ENGINE support in your files only. You do NOT edit the show file. For every new param
or behaviour, write the cue changes that use it into `$ENDSHOW_DATA/work/r11_fx/cue_patch.json` as
`{"edits":[{"match":{"t":<exact t>,"sys":"..","fx":".."},"set":{"p.<param>":<value>, "dur":..},"why":"..","measured":".."}],
"adds":[{<full cue>,"why":"..","measured":".."}],"removes":[{"t":..,"sys":"..","fx":"..","why":".."}]}` — test each
in the page first (patch the cue list in-page via __app.show, recompile, render with vcompare/similarity) and record the
measured effect; a show agent applies the patches of all groups after the merge. Default behaviour of existing cues
must not change unless it measurably improves the 64 moments. In parallel a features workflow edits
src/camera/CameraRig.ts, src/player/**, src/ui/**, src/mobile/**, src/audio/**, src/postfx/PostFX.ts + shaders.ts,
src/core/App.ts, Input.ts, types.ts, EventBus.ts, target.ts, src/world/landmarks.ts, site.ts, Terrain.ts,
structures.ts, Grounds.ts, src/intoxication/**, src/bar/**: never edit those.

- fog.lowfog particles still linger ~13 s in several spans (04: a 2 s bank at v602.25-603.75 covers the next 13 s;
  10: the red finale bank must end at 1533.4 to be gone by v1537.4). Round 9 added a release; verify it works for these
  cases and add a bounded particle `life` or a `clear` at the cue end if needed; propose the cue params.
- A large white smoke roll-out over the deck and field for a single flash cue (v1416.84: the terrace frame fills with
  lit white smoke within 0.2 s).

## Verify / stop
Touched moments + holdouts (in-page patches for cue-dependent features), then the default 64
(`--out "$ENDSHOW_DATA/work/sim/r11_fx_64"`) with the committed code: never lower the 64-moment calibrated score (noise
~1 point). tsc, no console errors, deterministic, no per-frame allocations, mobile budget PASS
(`node scripts/budget-check.mjs --base http://localhost:<port>/`). Document new params in your docs/show-format-ext file
and, if the validator must know them, list them in contractRequests (scripts/validate-show.mjs is the orchestrator's).

Files you own: src/fx/** EXCEPT src/fx/core/placement.ts and FxLights.ts.
NOT: everything else (other groups and the features workflow run in parallel); never the show file.
